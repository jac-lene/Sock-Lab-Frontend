FRONTEND PLAN

What are my MVP goals?
    - an image of a sock that can be clicked and change color
    - a pattern that changes based on the user input
    - a visual library that stores all of my saved designs

What are my stretch goals? 
    - user auth
    - yarn store map
    - more than one type of garment/pattern

How to accomplish each part: 

Pattern

    - figure out information needed for model
    - link to pdf or print

Design Page

    - design save button 
    - prompt for name upon saving
    - if there are colors in the sock, have a modal when you try to navigate away from the page
