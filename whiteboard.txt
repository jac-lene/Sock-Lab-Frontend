FRONTEND PLAN

What are my MVP goals?
    - an image of a sock that can be clicked and change color
    - a pattern that changes based on the user input
    - a visual library that stores all of my saved designs

What are my stretch goals? 
    - user auth
    - yarn store map
    - more than one type of garment/pattern

How to accomplish each part: 

Sock Image
    - Div mask? 
    - image cut into pieces and placed in an absolute positioning
    - information will link to a form internally
    - color overlay?
    - need color palette plan 
    - figure out randomizer

Pattern 
    - "Visible" form element
    - Is live inputting as the item is clicked - maybe? 
    - OR, generate pattern button
    - link to pdf or print

Visual Library
    - Simply a show page, should be easy.

Layout
    - Would love checker border
    - Spinning CHAOS MODE button
    - generate pattern button
    - Detail page needs to be designed
    - Different headers for different parts of the site
